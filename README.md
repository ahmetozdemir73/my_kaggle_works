# my_kaggle_works
I created this repo to share my Kaggle works (data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, etc.)

- [**city-quality-of-life-data-visualization:**](https://github.com/ahmetozdemir73/my_kaggle_works/blob/main/city-quality-of-life-data-visualization.ipynb) My data visualization work for [City Quality of Life Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/orhankaramancode/city-quality-of-life-dataset). Includes the following titles: 
    - Swarmplot for the Economies of the Continents
    - Swarmplot for the Safety of the Continents
    - Swarmplot for the Business Freedom of the Continents
    - Average Values of the Continents
    - Top 50 Safest and Unsafe Cities
    - 50 Cities with Lowest and Highest Cost of Living
    - 50 Cities with Lowest and Highest Business Freedom
    - Education vs Cost of Living
    - Education vs Business Freedom
- [**diabetes-classification-ann:**](https://github.com/ahmetozdemir73/my_kaggle_works/blob/main/diabetes-classification-ann%20(1).ipynb) In this work, I first classified diabetes using logistic regression, then using ANN. And I compared the results. I used [Pima Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/gargmanas/pima-indians-diabetes/tasks?taskId=4236) dataset. 
- [**gender-classification-logistic-regression:**](https://github.com/ahmetozdemir73/my_kaggle_works/blob/main/gender-classification-logistic-regression.ipynb) In this work, I tried to explain logistic regression. Using the [Gender Recognition by Voice Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender), I applied the logistic regression algorithm first without sklearn and then with sklearn.
- [**heart-disease-classification:**](https://github.com/ahmetozdemir73/my_kaggle_works/blob/main/heart-disease-classification.ipynb) In this work, I made classification using different ML models on the [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and compared the results. The notebook contains the following models:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Naive Bayes
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
- [**ml-classification-algorithms-with-scikit-learn:**](https://github.com/ahmetozdemir73/my_kaggle_works/blob/main/ml-classification-algorithms-with-scikit-learn.ipynb) In this notebook, I tried to explain in detail the classical ML models and their use with the sklearn library. I used [Gender Recognition by Voice Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender).
